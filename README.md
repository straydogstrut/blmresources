# BLM Resources
A collection of #BlackLivesMatter resources

This site exists to signpost resources to educate and inform on issues of systemic racism, white supremacy and racial inequality. While our social media feeds are ever-changing, these structures - and the people who suffer as a result - remain.

To that end I will maintain this site as a reminder that our work is not done. As a white male, I feel it is vital to recognise my privilege, learn from the lived experience of others, and question my complicity in the status quo.

Contributions are very welcome.

The intended organisation of the site is as follows:

* Activism - For things you can do now (signing petitions, fundraising etc)
* Education - For the vital work of unlearning racial prejudices
* Support - For mental health and self-care resources, particularly those aimed at BIPOC communities
* Promote - For suggested BIPOC business and creators to support
* Access - For tips and resources to make information more accessible

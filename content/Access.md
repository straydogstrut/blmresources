### Inclusive Action

In-person protests are not accessible to everyone. For a variety of reasons someone may not be able to attend safely. While it's important to raise awareness of these events, we shouldn't abuse people who are not there in person.

Other forms of protest exist and we can always do more to make these spaces - physical and virtual - more accessible to everyone.

### Inclusive Social Media

Social media can be a powerful force for good. However, whether due to biased assumptions or a lack of understanding of the diverse range of people who use these platforms, content can be widely shared that is inaccessible to a variety of people. We can all strive to make our content accessible.

#### Provide alternative text for images

Some people use text-to-speech software such as a screen reader to access websites and applications. Without an alternative for non-text content such as images, icons and charts, people may miss out on crucial information. In many cases a screen reader will simply announce the filename which may not be helpful at all(!)

* To add alternative text on Instagram
* To add alternative text on Facebook

Note that it is currently not possible to add alternative text to Instagram Stories. Consider using the text feature to add Captions.

#### Avoid images of text where possible

It's very popular to share images with quotes or other sentiments, particularly on Instagram. Where possible avoid doing so since people using text-to-speech software may be unable to access this content without a text alternative.

Also, text within an image does not scale and may pixelate at larger sizes. This can cause problems for people who rely on adjusting the page zoom or magnification software.

If text in an image cannot be avoided, ensure that this is provided by a caption or as a transcript in the tweet or post itself.

#### Provide captions or transcripts for video (ideally both!)

Video can be a vital tool for education and accountability. However people who cannot perceive the content of the video may miss out on the context and key information.

*Captions* can be beneficial for people who cannot perceive the audio of the video, such as those who are deaf or Hard of Hearing or whose first language is not the same as the video audio. They can also be beneficial for people who are watching the video in a noisy environment or without sound.

When providing captions, remember to include any audio important for context and understanding such as music and sound effects as well as the dialogue.

*Transcripts* can be beneficial for people who cannot perceive the visuals of the video, such as those who are blind or have a temporary eye condition. They can also be beneficial for people who are viewing a video in a low visibility environment such as in direct sunlight. The text of a transcript is usually available to assistive technologies so can be available to text-to-speech software such as screen readers and read aloud software.

Transcripts can also be beneficial for anyone who needs control over the delivery of information and those using translation software. When providing transcripts, remember to include any visual cues important for context and understanding.

Remember that for Deaf audiences, sign language is usually their first language. Captions and transcripts, while helpful, are not a direct replacement.

#### Write hashtags using CamelCase

Screen readers and other text-to-speech software announce text as written with the necessary pauses for punctuation. Writing hashtags in all lowercase can cause multiple words to be announced as a single word. Writing hashtags in all uppercase can cause the individual letters to be announced like an acronym.

Capitalise the first letter of each word to signal to assistive technologies where the appropriate pauses are. This also makes hashtags easier to read.

#### Use emojis considerately

Screen readers and other text-to-speech software will announce emojis based on their official character names in the Unicode Standard. See the [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/). This may not always be a true reflection of their meaning in the current context.

Where many emojis are used next to each other or after each word (it's popular to use the clapping hands emoji in this way, for example), the text can become practically unreadable for people using a screen reader.

Lindsey Kopacz has [a great article](https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/blog/7-ways-tweets-more-accessible) that pulls together examples of these issues.

#### Don't use special characters in your bio or tweets

These are actually math and symbol fonts that will either be skipped by screen readers and other text-to-speech software or announced as their symbol equivalents. The result of a pretty tweet can be an unreadable mess.

Kent C. Dodds' [example tweet](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1083073242330361856) illustrates this well.

Same goes for those images made from punctuation symbols. It may look clever but it's nonsense to a screen reader.

#### Provide information in an 'easy read' format where possible

Everyone has a right to equal access to public information. This is particularly important for information about social issues and current events.

Dense information, complex jargon and abstract concepts can be difficult for some people to understand. This can include people with learning disabilities or a language impairment such as Aphasia.

Providing information in an 'easy read' format does not mean dumbing down the information. It means considering the barrier to entry with the language we use and supporting multi-channel communication.

Using simple, straightforward, clear language is good for readability and benefits everyone. This can be supplemented by appropriate graphics. For example, Jade French created a (draft) [easy read document about George Floyd and Black Lives Matter](https://www.jade-french.com/news/george-floyd-and-black-lives-matter-accessible-summary-draft-1).

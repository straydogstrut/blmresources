## Silence is Violence

This site exists to signpost resources to educate and inform on issues of systemic racism, white supremacy and racial inequality. While our social media feeds are ever-changing, these structures - and the people who suffer as a result - remain.

To that end I will maintain this site as a reminder that our work is not done. As a white male, I feel it is vital to recognise my privilege, learn from the lived experience of others, and question my complicity in the status quo.

## Acknowledgements

Collating this much information in such a short space of time would not have been possible without the resources sign-posted by others. My heartfelt thanks to everyone who is offering support and sharing information at this difficult time.

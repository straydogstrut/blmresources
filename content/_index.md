## Silence is Violence

This site exists to signpost resources to educate and inform on issues of systemic racism, white supremacy and racial inequality. While our social media feeds are ever-changing, these structures and the people who suffer as a result, remain.

To that end I will maintain this site as a reminder that our work is not done. As a white male, I feel it is vital to recognise my privilege and question my complicity in the status quo.

* For ways to take immediate action now, see [Activism](/activism)
* To identify and unlearn racial prejudices, see [Education](/education)
* For ways to look after ourselves and promote the work of others, see [Support](/support)
* To make our accessible to as many people as possible, see [Access](/access)

Collating this much information in such a short space of time would not have been possible without the resources sign-posted by others. My heartfelt thanks to everyone who is offering support and sharing information at this difficult time.
